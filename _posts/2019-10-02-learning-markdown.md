# Markdown 101
Markdown is not HTML, but it is a syntax that translates to HTML. You cannot just view .md files in the browser - there has to be a program to convert it into HTML that browsers can render.

## Brief History
According to Wikipedia:

> John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".

Today, Markdown is used pretty extensively on sites used by professional technologist like GitHub, Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, OpenStreetMap, and SourceForge. These sites use a variant of Markdown to tailored for their purposes, but the underlying principles are kept intact. By designing Markdown to be extensible, Gruber was able to increase the longevity of the format!

## Standardization
John Gruber’s canonical description of Markdown’s syntax does not specify the syntax unambiguously.

In the absence of a spec, early implementers consulted the original Markdown.pl code to resolve these ambiguities. But Markdown.pl was quite buggy, and gave manifestly bad results in many cases, so it was not a satisfactory replacement for a spec. Markdown.pl was last updated December 17th, 2004.

The most commonly applied standard is called CommonMark.
