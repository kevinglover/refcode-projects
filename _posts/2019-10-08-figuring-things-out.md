# Figuring things out

Sometimes it feels like I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm lost in thought, and I feel paralyzed by all the things I feel like I should be accomplishing and not. Worst of all, I know I've been here before - this is a reoccuring feeling, which means that there's no _cure_ for this feeling. In some sense, there's a strange comfort in this realization. Nothing's ever really done and gone - there is always something new around the corner. Sometimes it's a feeling of anxiety, other times it may be a sense of accomplishment or thrill of acchievement. The important thing is that to remember that, no matter the feeling, this too will pass. The problem that you have now will be resolved. There are a ton of things that need to get done, and I will be able to get them done. However, after I get those things done, there will me still more to do. It's a never-ending queue of things to discover, problems to solve, things to figure out. Just take it one step at a time.
